# ofxPopeye

openFrameworks addon that receives pose and hand data from the [popeye app](https://github.com/thomasgeissl/popeye).
This is still a work in progress and aims to be a quick and dirty, easy to setup alternative to the kinect, realsense, ... skeleton tracking solutions. It is hopefully useful for early stage prototyping, no special hardware required.
